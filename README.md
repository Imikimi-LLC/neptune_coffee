# NeptuneCoffee

## What is it?

* opinionated javascript-AMD-module generator

## Purpose

* make working with javascript AMD modules easier
* minimize refactoring complexity
* minimize the amount of code you have to write
* integrate easily with javascript or coffeescript projects

If you are working with dozens or hundreds of Javascript files, wouldn't you like some way to easily organize them into modules?

NeptuneCoffee is an opinionated module generator. Modules and namespaces are automatically generated based on the project's directory names and structure.

NeptuneCoffee generates the .js files to define your AMD modules.

## Opinionated?
NeptuneCoffee has an opinion about how you should organize your javascript for AMD modules. It is:

* Directories are AMD modules
* Directory names the AMD module names
* Directory names snake_case
* generated AMD module names are CamelCase
* require "foo/bar" includes all files in the module defined by the directory "foo/bar"
* Defines a global namespace for accessing AMD modules: window.Neptune.YourRootModule.YourSubModule

## Benefit

Refactoring module structure is as simple as renaming and moving directories and files. Often you won't have to change a line of code.

## What does it do?

For every $subdir, NeptuneCoffee generates:

	$subdir/namespace.js  // defines $subdir's namespace object
	$subdir.js            // loads all .js files in $subdir recursively
	                      // all three files return $subdir's namespace object

## WARNING: Work in Progress
This is a work in progress. Unlikely to change:
* directories-define-modules
* including the directory_name.js to included the module
* include ./namespace.js to get the local module's namespace

# How to Use

Install neptune_coffee (see below). Then, whenever your directory structure changes or you move/add/rename/delete files, run:

    neptune_coffee -r source/root

* Client should require: **$subdir.js** for the AMD module **source/root/$subdir**
* Source files in **source/root/$subdir/** should require: **./namespace.js**

## Example

Given this directory structure and files:

    geometry/solids/cone.js
    geometry/box.js
    geometry/circle.js

NeptuneCoffee generates:

	geometry.js
	geometry/namespace.js
	geometry/solids.js
	geometry/solids/namespace.js

geometry.js might look like:

	// Generated by NeptuneCoffee 0.0.2
	define([
	  './geometry/namespace'
	  './geometry/box'
	  './geometry/circle'
	  './geometry/solids'
	], function(Geometry) {
	  return Geometry;
	});
